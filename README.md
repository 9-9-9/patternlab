Pattern Lab
==
Making pattern libraries using Atomic Design

## Why 

## What 

## Who

## Where

## How

## General Principles
- Agnostic - not a PHP solution. Not a Hammer solution. 
- Reduce dependencies as much as possible
- Strive to be as inclusive as possible
- Strive to be useful for many audiences (clients, designers, developers, content owners)
- What is built now is not final

## Front-facing 
- When should a new pattern be created?

## Roadmap
- Mustache for templates and extensibility. Separate data from view
- Use YML or JSON to store data
- Annotations
- Versioning
- Clicking through to other t	emplanes
- Pattern Lab Themes: E-commerce, blog, brochure-ware, etc...

Pattern Lab consists of a Builder and Viewer (isn, view modes, and project-specific data)
